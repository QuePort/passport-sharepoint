# Passport-SharePoint

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategy for authenticating with [SharePoint 2013](http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/.com/) OnPremise and O365 using the OAuth 2.0 API.

This module lets you authenticate using SharePoint 2013 OnPremise or O365 in your Node.js applications.
By plugging into Passport, SharePoint authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-sharepoint

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The SharePoint authentication strategy authenticates users using a SharePoint 2013 OnPremise or O365
account using OAuth 2.0.  The strategy requires a `verify` callback, which
accepts these credentials and calls `done` providing a user, as well as
`options` specifying a app ID, app secret, and callback URL.

    passport.use(new SharePointStrategy({
        appId: SHAREPOINT_APP_ID ,
        appSecret: SHAREPOINT_APP_SECRET ,
        callbackURL: "http://localhost:3000/auth/sharepoint/callback"
      },
      function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {
        User.findOrCreate({ userID: profile.id }, function (err, user) {
          return done(err, user);
        });
      }
    ));
    
#### Configure SharePoint AppPart

On the SharePoint side you need a provider hosted AppPart that talks to you Node.JS server and you must register your Node.JS server as a app.
The AppPart you can simply create via the VS2012 AppPart wizard.
These AppPart must define the `StandardTokens` as the url parameter so that the strategy can work.

    <Content Type="html" Src="https://nodeserver:3000/auth/sharepoint?{StandardTokens}" />

The Node.JS Server you can register as an app at
`https://sharepoint/_layouts/15/AppRegNew.aspx`
The app id and app secret you specify here is used in our strategy.

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'sharepoint'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

    app.get('/auth/sharepoint',
      passport.authenticate('sharepoint'),
      function(req, res){
        // The request will be redirected to SharePoint for authentication, so
        // this function will not be called.
      });

    app.get('/auth/sharepoint/callback', 
      passport.authenticate('sharepoint', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
      function(req, res) {
        // Successful authentication, redirect home.
        res.redirect('/');
      });
